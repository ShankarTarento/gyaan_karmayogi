flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/play.svg
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/pdf.svg
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/link.svg
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/igot_creator_icon.png 
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/image_placeholder.jpg
    - packages/gyaan_karmayogi_resource_list/assets/audio.svg

    
    
    
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
